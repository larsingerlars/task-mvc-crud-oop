# Project: Build a To do List

My (unfinished, still in progress) assignment result to build an basic CRUD app with PHP, following the MVC structure and OOP and connecting to a mysql database.

## Development Setup

-- XAMPP is used in development
-- local development path: http://localhost/projects/MVC/public/index.php
-- starting point: public/index.php

## Next steps

Some considerations at this point:

- optimize template views by dividing into smaller pieces
- check optimization potential for input sanitization
- implement input error handling client-side
- optimize routing
- add completion functionality (if task has been completed or not)
- add search functionality on index view
